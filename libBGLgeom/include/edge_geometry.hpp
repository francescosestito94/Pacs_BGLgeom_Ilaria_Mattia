	@brief	Abstract class for an edge

	It specifies all the geometric operation that should be carried
	out on an edge, thought as a curve in the space (2 or 3 dimensional).
	In particular, it defines, for a given value of the parameter: \n
	- evaluation of the curve; \n
	- evaluation of the first derivative; \n
	- evaluation of the second derivative; \n
	- evaluation of the curvature; \n
	- evaluation of the curvilinear ascissa. \n
	It provides also evaluation of this characteristics for a single value
	or for a vector of values of the parameter
